        <content><![CDATA[<p><b>Berlin </b>- In the hope to increase their summer business, German butchers have introduced several new&nbsp; exotic-tasting sausages with flavors ranging from kiwi, maraschino cherry, lemon and even aloe vera.</p>
<p>The variety of new ingredients may seem like heresy to what is for many ordinary Germans the national dish. But besides, these new flavors may help negate stagnant demand for the greasy Bratwurst you can find on almost any street corner.</p>
<p>Berlin butcher Uwe Buenger has developed a &quot;chili-honey&quot; Bratwurst while rival Dankert has come up with a &quot;kiwi wurst&quot; that also includes pineapples and maraschino cherries, Bild newspaper reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>For sausage connoisseurs, there is also the &quot;Truefflebratwurst&quot; that includes truffle, a fungus spiced with black and white pepper. Other sausages in Berlin are made of lamb, ginger, parsley, cardamom and edible blossoms.</p>]]></content>
