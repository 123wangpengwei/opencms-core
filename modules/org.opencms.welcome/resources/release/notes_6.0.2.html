<H2>What's New in Version 6.0.2?</H2>
<P>For a complete list of features of OpenCms 6.0.2, have a look at the <A 
href="${link0}" target=_self>OpenCms 6.0.0 
release notes</A>.</P>
<H2>Backward compatibility</H2>
<p>         
                 
       
        We recommend everyone who
uses an earlier version of OpenCms to update to the 6.0.2
release, even if you are using the final 6.0.0 version.</p>
<P>To upgrade&nbsp;an existing&nbsp;OpenCms 6.0.0 version to the current 6.0.2 
release, simply use the upgrade wizard that is coming with this distribution. 
The provided upgrade wizard guides you through the update process to avoid 
update errors of manual update procedures.</P>
<P>In case you are using one of the previous development versions (OpenCms 6 
alpha, beta or release candidates), there have been a lot of issues fixed in the 
upgrade release. If you still use OpenCms 5.0.x, you should definitely consider 
an update since the 6.0.2 version is much more advanced and stable.</P>
<P>OpenCms 6 is largely backward compatible with the 5.x releases. Existing 
content from 5.x is easily importable, automatically converted to the new XML 
page format and requires almost no manual modification - at least if you didn't 
somehow change the structure of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page 
files.</P>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that break existing 5.0 code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes is
necessary in order to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious is the
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work is most often just a matter of exchanging these
import statements and some minor adjustments. Please refer to the
Alkacon Documentation regarding the details of the upgrade process
from 5.0.x to 6.0.2.<br>
</p>
<H2>Compatibility with&nbsp;Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</H2>
<p>OpenCms 6.0.2 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work
with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK.
However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.* packages
that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with
all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to
some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.0.2 works "out of the box" with
Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of Xerces
is required like in OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported deploying
6.0.2 development versions successfully on other servlet containers
like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>     On the database side, we have
tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL
support has been contributed as well thanks to Antonio Core. The version 5.0
MS SQL Server has not been updated to OpenCms 6.0.2 so far, and we
still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0.2 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
"supported platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0.2 run on your platforms, please contribute these
so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<H2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</H2>
<P>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following 
in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6 final release are "build_6_0_x", 
so the 6.0.0 release is tagged "build_6_0_0". OpenCms 6 alpha had CVS build tags 
5.5.x, the&nbsp;6 beta did use 5.7.x, and the 6 RC had5.9.x.</P>
<P>You can also check out the current development version of OpenCms by 
selecting the "dev_6_0_x" branches of the CVS. The development version provides 
new features which will likely be added to future stable OpenCms versions, but 
is considered to be not as stable as the CVS head. Keep that in mind if you want 
to use the OpenCms development branch.</P>
<H2>How you can help</H2>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome.
Please contact <A href="${link1}">contributions@opencms.org</A> in
case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms 6,
or give your feedback on the <A href="${link2}" target=_self>opencms-dev</A> mailing list.</p>
<p>Please use our Bugzilla to report bugs in this release: <a href="${link3}" target="_self">http://www.opencms.org/bugzilla/</a></p>
<p>Thank you for using OpenCms and have fun with OpenCms 6.0.2
:-)</p>]]></content>
