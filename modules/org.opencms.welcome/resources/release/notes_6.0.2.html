<p>For a complete list of features of OpenCms 6 compared to older
versions, have a look at the <a target="_self" href="${link0}">OpenCms 6.0.0 release
notes</a>.</p>
<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>OpenCms 6.0.2 should be highly backward compatible with version
6.0.0. Certain bug fixes required minor API changes so some
adjustments may have to be made for code that uses more advanced
API functions such as custom resource types. All Templates should
be backward compatible without changes.<br />
</p>
<p>To upgrade an existing OpenCms 6.0.0 version to the current
6.0.2 release, a new upgrade wizard is available for this
distribution. This upgrade wizard guides you through the update
process and makes upgrading OpenCms really easy. Please note: Even
though the upgrade wizard has been well tested, always make a
backup of your current installation before upgrading as a
precaution to avoid loss of customized data.<br />
</p>
<p>In case you are using one of the previous development versions
(OpenCms 6 alpha, beta or release candidates), there have been a
lot of issues fixed so you should definitely update. If you still
use OpenCms 5.0.x, you should also update since the 6.0.2 version
is much more advanced and stable.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and
Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 6.0.2 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work
with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK.
However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.* packages
that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with
all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to
some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.0.2 works &quot;out of the box&quot; with
Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. Others have reported
deploying 6.0.x versions successfully on other servlet containers
like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL
4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed thanks to Antonio Core. maxDB support has been contributed
thanks to Clovis Wichoski and Fabiano Rech. MS SQL server support
is not included in this release, but has been contributed by Andras
Balogh and will be available in a future release. We still are
looking for volunteers to support testing the stability of the
PostgetSQL, maxDB and MS SQL server releases.<br />
</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0.2 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
&quot;supported platforms&quot;. Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0.2 run on your platforms, please contribute
these so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep
the following in mind: The CVS tag for the 6.0.2 release is
&quot;build_6_0_2&quot;. Development of further bug fix releases is done in
CVS HEAD.<br />
</p>
<p>The next major feature update of OpenCms will be version 6.2.0.
You can check out the current development version by selecting the
&quot;dev_6_0_1&quot; branch of the CVS. The development version provides new
features which will be added to future stable OpenCms versions, but
is considered to be not as stable as the CVS HEAD. The development
version uses the version numbers 6.1.x and is likewise tagged in
the CVS.</p>
