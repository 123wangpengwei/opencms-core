      <content><![CDATA[<h2>  Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0</h2>
<p>         
06/29/2005: This is the OpenCms 6.0 final release. OpenCms 6.0 is a
major upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms
5.0. The re-write of the Workplace "Administration" view is finished.
Furthermore, there is now a new module for the&nbsp;german localization of OpenCms&nbsp;available.
6.0 also contains numerous fixes applied since 6.0 RC 2. We are
confident that this final release is pretty stable, since the
6.0 release candidate versions are already used successfully in quite a lot
of "live" installations.</p>
<p><strong> Who should use this 6.0 version?</strong></p>
<p>In this final release, the core features of OpenCms are 
completed, and should run stable. 
</p>
<p>    We believe that this 6.0 version is
stable enough to be used in a production system. It's likely to be
more stable than the OpenCms&nbsp;5.0.1 release.</p>
<p>If and how you should use this version depends on what your
goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are starting a new OpenCms project, you should 
  use this 6.0 and not 5.0.1.</li><li>If you are currently using any previous 6.0 
  development release (e.g. 6.0 alpha 1, 2, 3 , beta 1, 2, 3, or RC 1,&nbsp;2), 
  you should upgrade to this new version in case you have encountered issues 
  with the release you are using.</li><li>If you are running a website based on OpenCms 5.0.1,
and you want to upgrade, please install and read the documentation module
"documentation_migration".<br >
</li>
</ul>
<p>   You can help speeding up the process of
development by providing feedback for this release and the
following releases, especially regarding bugs. In case you find any
bug, please use the <a href="${link0}" target="_self">OpenCms bugzilla</a> to document
it, or at least post a note to the <A href="${link1}" target=_self>opencms-dev</a> 
mailing list. The more feedback and code contributions are made, the faster we 
can fix the issues and finish the development.</p>
<p><strong>The most important new features
in this&nbsp;final release compared to the&nbsp;RC&nbsp;2&nbsp;version:</strong><FONT size=3></p></FONT>
<UL>
  <LI>Improved implementation of request "forwarding" in Flex JSP handler</LI>
  <LI>Fixed JavaScript issues in IE (in new Administration) caused by 
  "sendRedirect" usage</LI>
  <LI>Fixed issue with confusing redirect to localhost in a simple broken site 
  configuration</LI>
  <LI>Name of the web application and OpenCms servlet can now be passed to the 
  CmsShell&nbsp;</LI></UL>
<p><strong>The most important new features in this release compared
to the 5.0.x version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple websites can now be managed in one OpenCms 
  installation</li><li>The "Direct Edit" feature allows users to open the 
  editor directly from the websites front-end by pushing an "Edit" button that 
  appears on elements on the page (if the user has the permissions to edit it)</li><li>Using the new resource type "XmlContent", building 
  structured content (e.g. news articles, product descriptions etc.) is really 
  easy and requires little or no programming</li><li>OpenCms now comes with a highly configurable template 
  with many advanced functions as additional default module</li><li>Multi-language versions of the same page and improved 
  support for managing multi language websites is integrated</li><li>Build-in support for full text search in HTML, PDF, 
  Word, Excel and Plaintext documents (based on Apache Lucene)</li><li>All contents in the VFS can now have a "publication 
  date" and an "expiration date" so they can appear / disappear automatically 
  from a website</li><li>Resource permissions in the VFS are now managed in 
  ACLs instead of Unix - style</li><li>The OpenCms workplace has been rewritten in JSP, 
  adding new features and much improved usability (this task is not fully 
  finished)</li><li>All new, much more user friendly "Administration" 
  pages (this task is not fully finished)</li><li>Full support for multibyte languages (e.g. UTF-8)</li><li>Files in the VFS can now have multiple "siblings", 
  this is comparable to a "hard link" in a Unix file system and prevents broken 
  "VFS links" automatically</li><li>Properties on files can be "individual" or "shared" 
  among siblings</li><li>It's not poossible to configure a "secure" (e.g. 
  https-) server for a site</li><li>Individual documents can be marked as secure, so that 
  they are transmitted via this secure server</li><li>Optimizations of search queries for the full text 
  search engine</li><li>Implement "plugin" mechanism for editors and make 
  editors more configurable, so that other editor implementations (e.g. WYSIWYG 
  Java Applet) can be easily integrated in the workplace</li><li>Added optional WYSIWYG editor implementation of the 
  popular HtmlArea editor, this editor also works with Mozilla browsers</li><li>The setup wizard has been improved, also many "known 
  issues" (e.g. regarding encoding setting and Xerces version) have been fixed</li><li>The module API has been rewritten from the ground up, 
  now providing a clean interface to implement</li><li>Optimized the use of http headers, including use of 
  "304 - not modified" for resources that have not been modified</li><li>The resource type API has been enhanced, so that 
  resource types can be easily added without workarounds</li><li>The Workplace is now fully usable with Mozilla based 
  browsers (e.g. Firefox)</li><li>It's not longer required to "lock" a resource in the 
  Explorer with the context menu manually, this is done automatically if the 
  "autolock" feature is enabled (this is also the default)</li><li>The static export has been fully rewritten, is also 
  features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources</li><li>Implement new, cleaned up XmlPage API that replaces 
  the old XmlTemplate for page data storage</li><li>The XmlPage structure is always validated by a W3C 
  XML Schema, to prevent creation of invalid content</li><li>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required</li><li>The OpenCms VFS has been made much more scalable, 
  bottlenecks like the slow Explorer tree have been removed</li><li>The OpenCms user management has been made independent 
  from the OpenCms VFS, so that other user directories can be "plugged" into the 
  system as a separate module</li><li>Publishing has been rewritten and is now much faster 
  especially with many resources</li><li>All resources in the OpenCms VFS now have a UUID</li><li>The database pooling has been replaced with DBCP from

  that is read by Apache Digester (this task is not fully finished)</li><li>UTF-8 is now the default encoding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.0 is
released:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required!</li></ul>
<p><strong>Regarding backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 is largely backward compatible with the 5.x releases.
Existing content from 5.x is easily importable, automatically
converted to the new XML page format and requires almost no manual
modification - at least if you didn't somehow change the structure
of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page files.</p>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that break existing 5.0 code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes is
necessary in order to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious is the
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work is most often just a matter of exchanging these
import statements and some minor adjustments. Please refer to the
Alkacon Documentation regarding the details of the upgrade process
from 5.0.x to 6.0.<br >
</p>
<p><strong>Regarding support for XmlTemplates and the "Master
Module"</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 does have support for legacy XmlTemplates, but only
with an additional <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> that is not longer
part of the core and requires the installation of an additional
module. All classes dealing with XmlTemplates will stay in the
com.opencms.* packages where they are now. We consider XmlTemplate
a "dead" technology and will not support it past the 6.0
release.<br >
</p>
<p>The "master module" technology of 5.0.x has been replaced by the
new XmlContent mechanism. Therefore all database tables that are
used for the master module and some others (like the "webusers"
table) have also been moved to a separate module
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> that installs these
tables if required.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding version numbers and CVS build
tags</strong></p>
<p>           
       In case you want to check out OpenCms 
from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The 
CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6 final release are "build_6_0_x. OpenCms 6 alpha had 
CVS build tags 5.5.x, the&nbsp;6 beta did use 5.7.x, and the 6 RC had5.9.x.
</p>
<p><strong>Regarding compatibility with other JVMs / Servlet
containers / Databases</strong></p>
<p> OpenCms 6.0 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work
with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK.
However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.* packages
that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with
all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>  We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine
and to some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.0 works "out of the box"
with Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of
Xerces is required like in OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported
deploying 6.0 development versions successfully on other servlet
containers like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL
4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed as
well thanks to Antonio Core, but we at Alkacon have not tested it.
The MS SQL Server and the SAP DB port have not been updated to
OpenCms 6.0 so far, and we still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
"supported platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these
so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome.
