      <content><![CDATA[<H1>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0.0</H1>
<p>06/29/2005: This is the OpenCms 6.0.0 final release. 
OpenCms 6.0.0 is a major upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms 5.0. OpenCms 6.0.0 has been in public beta
testing for more than 6 months now and therefore&nbsp;can be considered very
stable.</p>
<H2>What's New in Version 6.0?</H2>
<p><strong><strong>Working with content&nbsp;has
been&nbsp;simplified</strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The "Direct Edit" feature allows users to open the 
  editor directly from the websites front-end by pushing an "Edit" button that 
  appears on page elements</li><LI>Added an optional WYSIWYG editor implementation of 
  the popular HtmlArea editor, this editor also works with Mozilla (Firefox) 
  browsers&nbsp;</LI><li>All contents in the VFS can have a "publication date" 
  and an "expiration date" so they can appear / disappear automatically from a 
  website</li><LI>Using the new resource type "XmlContent", building 
  structured content (e.g. news articles, product descriptions etc.) can be done 
  by simply creating an XML schema
  </LI><LI>The OpenCms workplace has been rewritten in JSP, adding new features and 
  much improved usability</LI><li>Build-in support for full text search in HTML, 
  PDF,&nbsp;MS Office&nbsp;and Plaintext documents&nbsp;</li><LI>OpenCms now comes with a highly configurable template 
  with many advanced functions as additional default module&nbsp;</LI><LI>It's not longer required to "lock" a resource in the Explorer with the 
  context menu manually, this is done automatically if the "autolock" feature is 
  enabled (this is also the default)</LI>
</ul>
<p><STRONG>Improvements of the file system 
structure</STRONG>     </p>
<ul>
<li>Files in the VFS can now have multiple "siblings", 
  this is comparable to a "hard link" in a Unix file system and prevents broken 
  "VFS links" automatically</li><LI>Properties on files can be "individual" or "shared" 
  among siblings</LI><LI>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required</LI>
</ul>
 
<p><strong>Multisite and internationalization support</strong></p>
<UL class=noindent>
  <LI>Multiple websites can now be managed in one OpenCms 
  installation</LI><LI>Multi-language versions of the same page and improved 
  support for managing multi language websites is integrated</LI><LI>Full support for multibyte languages (e.g. UTF-8, 
  which now is the standard encoding)
  </LI><LI>Microsites allow users to build "sites&nbsp;within sites"</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>    Improved security 
support</STRONG></P>
<UL class=noindent>
  <LI>Resource permissions in the VFS are now managed in access control lists 
  (ACL) instead of Unix - style</LI>
  <LI>It is&nbsp;now possible to configure a "secure" (e.g. https-) server for a 
  site. Individual documents can be marked as secure, so that they are 
  transmitted via this secure server
  </LI><LI>A user account is now automatically locked after a configurable number of 
  invalid login attempts</LI></UL>
<p><strong>Improvements regarding the usability of
OpenCms</strong></p>
<UL>
  <LI>There is a new&nbsp;and much 
  improved&nbsp;Administration</LI><LI>The setup wizard guides you through an uncomplicated 
  installation of the system. Also many "known issues" (e.g. regarding encoding 
  setting and Xerces version) have been fixed</LI><LI>The Workplace is now fully usable with Mozilla based browsers (e.g. 
  Firefox) </LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>    Changes to&nbsp;the database 
model</STRONG></P>
<UL>
  <LI>Publishing has been rewritten and is now much faster 
  especially with many resources</LI><LI>The static export has been fully rewritten, is also 
  features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources&nbsp;</LI><LI>Optimizations of search queries for the full text 
  search engine</LI><LI>The database pooling has been replaced with DBCP from 
  Apache Jakarta</LI><LI>Heavily modified the database model and completely 
  rewrote the database access class layer</LI><LI>The OpenCms VFS has been made much more scalable, 
  bottlenecks like the slow Explorer tree have been removed</LI><LI>All known issues with Oracle 9.x that were present in 
  5.0.x have been solved&nbsp;</LI><LI>Support for the PostgreSQL database contributed by 
  Antonio Core</LI><LI>All resources in the OpenCms VFS now have a UUID </LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>A&nbsp;cleaner&nbsp;OpenCms API for programmers</STRONG></P>
<UL>
  <LI>Implemented a&nbsp;new, cleaned up XmlPage API that 
  replaces the old XmlTemplate for page data storage</LI><LI>The resource type API has been enhanced, so that 
  resource types can be easily added without workarounds
  </LI><LI>Much improved JavaDoc for the whole core API</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>    OpenCms has been made more 
scalable</STRONG>         </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Implemented a&nbsp;"plugin" mechanism for editors and 
  make editors more configurable, so that other editor implementations (e.g. 
  WYSIWYG Java Applet) can be easily integrated in the workplace</LI><LI>The module API has been rewritten from ground up, now 
  providing a clean interface to implement</LI><LI>The OpenCms user management has been made independent 
  from the OpenCms VFS, so that other user directories can be "plugged" into the 
  system as a separate module
  </LI><LI>The scheduler API has been much improved,&nbsp;and an easy to use 
  scheduler GUI is provided</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Miscellaneous additions and improvements</STRONG></P>
<UL><li>Optimized the use of http headers, including use of 
  "304 - not modified" for resources that have not been modified</li><li>The XmlPage and XmlContent structure is always 
  validated by a W3C XML Schema, to prevent creation of invalid content</li><li>Logging now uses log4j from Apache Jakarta</li><li>The configuration is based on a new XML structure that 
  is read by Apache Digester&nbsp;</li></UL>
<H2>Backward compatibility</H2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses an earlier version of 
OpenCms to update to the 6.0.0 release. In case you are using one of the previous development versions
(OpenCms 6 alpha, beta or release candidates), there
have been a lot of issues fixed in the final release. If
you still use OpenCms 5.0.x, you should definitely consider an update
since the 6.0 version is much more advanced and stable.</p>
<P>OpenCms 6 is largely backward compatible with the 5.x releases. Existing 
content from 5.x is easily importable, automatically converted to the new XML 
page format and requires almost no manual modification - at least if you didn't 
somehow change the structure of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page 
files.</P>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that break existing 5.0 code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes is
necessary in order to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious is the
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work is most often just a matter of exchanging these
import statements and some minor adjustments. Please refer to the
Alkacon Documentation regarding the details of the upgrade process
from 5.0.x to 6.0.0.<br>
</p>
<H2>Compatibility with&nbsp;Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</H2>
<p>OpenCms 6.0.0 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work
with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK.
However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.* packages
that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with
all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to
some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.0.0 works "out of the box" with
Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of Xerces
is required like in OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported deploying
6.0.0 development versions successfully on other servlet containers
like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL
4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed as
well thanks to Antonio Core. The version 5.0 MS SQL Server and the
SAP DB port have not been updated to OpenCms 6.0.0 so far, and we
still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0.0 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
"supported platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these
so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<H2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</H2>
<P>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following 
in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6 final release are "build_6_0_x", 
so the 6.0.0 release is tagged "build_6_0_0". OpenCms 6 alpha had CVS build tags 
5.5.x, the&nbsp;6 beta did use 5.7.x, and the 6 RC had5.9.x.</P>
<H2>How you can help</H2>
