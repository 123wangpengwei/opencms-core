       <content><![CDATA[<h1>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.9.1</h1>
<p>Mai 2, 2007: This is the public release of OpenCms 7 RC 1 (6.9.1).</p>
<p>
<strong>Features of the OpenCms 7 RC 1 release:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7 RC 1 is written using Java 1.5. It works well with Java 1.4 using the optional "Java 1.4
compatibility package". It won't work with Java 1.3. Java 1.6 has been tested yet, but it
should work. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies
to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to some extend on JBoss 4.0.
OpenCms 7 RC 1 works "out of the box" with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have reported
deploying 7.x versions successfully on other servlet containers like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0, MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.0, Oracle 9.x and Oracle
10.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed thanks to Antonio Core and Ivan Codarin. maxDB
support has been contributed thanks to Clovis Wichoski and Fabiano Rech. MS SQL server support has
been contributed thanks to Andras Balogh. We still are looking for volunteers to support testing
the stability of the PostgreSQL, maxDB and MS SQL server releases.
<br /></p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS
tag for the 7 RC 1 release is "build_7rc_1". Development of maintenance releases (like 6.2.3) is
currently done in CVS HEAD. Development of the next major OpenCms 7.0 release is done in the
"DEV_7_0" branch.
<br /></p>
