      <content><![CDATA[<h2>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0 alpha 3</h2>
<p>12/22/2004: This is the third public binary alpha release of OpenCms 6.0. OpenCms 6.0 is a major
upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms 5.0. The alpha
3 release improves the alpha 2 version with new features for XML
content, fully re-written and much improved content galleries, plus support for JDK
5.0 (Java 1.5).</p>
<p><strong>Who should use this 6.0 alpha 3 version?</strong></p>
<p>This is an alpha version. Please don't expect it to be perfectly
stable. One of the most important Open Source philosophies is
"Release early, Release often", and this is what we intend to do
with this and subsequent 6.0 releases. If and how you should use
this version depends on what your goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are currently using any previous 6.0 
  development release (e.g. 6.0 alpha 1 or alpha 2), you should upgrade to this 
  new version.</li><li>If you are an IT professional or a company working 
  with OpenCms on a regular basis, you should definitely check if and how your 
  current websites, modules and functions can be ported to the new release. Even 
  though changes on the Java API level and changes on the DB schema are to be 
  expected until we reach the beta or even release candidate state of the 
  development, most of the big changes have already been made.</li><li>If you start a new project that is expected to go live 
  in about 3 months, you may use this version to build your project - but be 
  prepared for some extra work to update when new releases become available, and 
  also for some time figuring out the so far undocumented features if these are 
  required.</li><li>If you are working on a project with OpenCms 5.0.x 
  that has a delivery date soon, you should stick to the 5.0.x version unless 
  you absolutely require a feature of the 6.0 version.</li><li>If you are running a website based on OpenCms, and you plan to
implement some new features in the not so far future, you should
install this version on a test machine and check out the new
features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When will the "final" release of OpenCms 6.0 be
available?</strong></p>
<p>We now do expect the final release of OpenCms 6.0 end of 
Q1 2005. You can help speeding up the process of development&nbsp;by providing feedback for this release and
the following releases, especially regarding bugs. In case you find
any bug, please use the <a href="${link0}"
 target="_self">OpenCms bugzilla</a> to document it, or at least
post a note to the <A href="${link1}" target=_self>opencms-dev</A>    
         mailing list. The
more feedback and code contributions are made, the faster we
can fix the issues and finish the development.</p>

  features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources</li><li>Implement new, cleaned up XmlPage API that replaces 
  the old XmlTemplate for page data storage</li><li>The XmlPage structure is always validated by a W3C XML 
  Schema, to prevent creation of invalid content</li><li>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required</li><li>The OpenCms VFS has been made much more scalable, 
  bottlenecks like the slow Exlorer tree have been removed</li><li>The OpenCms user management has been made independent 
  from the OpenCms VFS, so that other user directories can be "plugged" into the 
  system as a separate module</li><li>Publishing has been rewritten and is now much faster 
  especially with many resources</li><li>All resources in the OpenCms VFS now have a UUID</li><li>The database pooling has been replaced with DBCP from

  5.0.x have been solved</li><li>Logging now uses log4j from Apache Jarkarta</li><li>Heavily modified the database model and completely 
  rewrote the database access class layer</li><li>The configuration is now based on a new XML structure 
  that is read by Apache Digester (this task is not fully finished)</li><li>UTF-8 is now the default encoding</li></UL>
<p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.0 is
released:</strong></p>
<UL>
<li>The OpenCms workplace is still not fully implemented 
  in JSP - all XmlTemplate using dialogs will be rewritten to JSP</li><li>More of the configuration will be transferred from 
  opencms.properties to the new Digester XML based configuration file, the 
  current opencms.properties will stay only for the database configuration - 
  this configuration will be moved to the XML in a release after 6.0.</li><li>The most important management functions (e.g. cache 
  maintainance, system status) will be exposed to allow JMX containers to manage 
  OpenCms</li><li>Documentation needs to be revised for old functions 
  and written for new functions</li><li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required!</li></UL>
<P>The development of the Content Releationship Engine (CRE)&nbsp;initially 
scheduled for the 6.0 release&nbsp;has been moved to a version past the 6.0 
release. &nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<p><strong>Regarding backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will be as backward compatible as possible with the
5.x releases. Existing content from 5.x will be easily importable,
automatically converted to the new format and require almost no
manual modification - at least if you didn't somehow change the
structure of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page files.</p>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that will break existing code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes will
be necessary to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious will be
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work will hopefully be just a matter of exchanging
these import statements and some minor adjustments.</p>
<p>We will try to provide a more detailed documentation for the
upgrade procedure from 5.0 to 6.0 as part of a later release. This
is on the TODO list.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding support for XmlTemplates and the "Master
Module"</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will have support for legacy XmlTemplates, but only
with an additional <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> that will not be
installed by default. All classes dealing with XmlTemplates will
stay in the com.opencms.* packages where they are now. We consider
XmlTemplate a "dead" technology and will not support it past the
6.0 release.</p>
<p>The "master module" technology of 5.0.x will be replaced by the
new XmlContent mechanism. Therefore all database tables that are
used for the master module and some others (like the "webusers"
table) have been moved to a separate module
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> that installs these
tables if required.</p>
<p>The current 6.0 development release still requires XmlTemplates
because parts of the OpenCms Workplace are still not updated to
JSP. Therefore <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> is currently installed
by default. This applies mostly to the "Administration" and the
"Workflow" views. As soon as these are rewritten to JSP the
<em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> will be moved to the optional
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> module. This is on the
TODO list.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding version numbers and CVS build
tags</strong></p>
<p> In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please
keep the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6
alpha releases are "build_5_5_x", e.g. 6.0 alpha&nbsp;3 is "build_5_5_4".
Until we finally publish OpenCms 6, we will continue to use 5.x as
internal CVS build tag numbers. 6 alpha will have CVS build tags
5.5.x, 6 beta will use 5.7.x, and 6 release candidates will use
5.9.x.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding compatibility with other JVMs / Servlet
containers / Databases</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6.0 alpha 2 requires Java 1.4.x. or Java 1.5.x. 
It won't work with Java 1.3.x. We have
tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, we have removed
the dependencies from all sun.* packages that were present in
OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with all compliant
JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release only on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms 6.0
alpha 2 works "out of the box" with Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and
Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of Xerces is required like in OpenCms
5.0.x. Others have reported deploying pre 6.0 alpha versions
successfully on other servlet containers like BEA Weblogic, SunONE
and JBoss.</p>
<p>           
          On the database side, we
have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1.x&nbsp;and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been
contributed as well thanks to Antonio Core, but we at Alkacon have
not tested it. The MS SQL Server and the SAP DB
port have not been updated to OpenCms 6.0 so far,
and we still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x&nbsp;/ MySQL
4.0.x or&nbsp;4.1.x&nbsp;/ Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a message to the
OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of "supported
platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code to make
OpenCms 6.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these so they
can be included in the official release.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome.
Please contact <A href="${link2}">contributions@opencms.org</A> in
