      <content><![CDATA[<h2>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0 RC 2</h2>
<p>       06/17/2005: This is
the second release candidate of OpenCms 6.0. OpenCms 6.0 is a major
upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms 5.0.
The re-write of the Workplace "Administration" view is finished. Furthermore,
there is now a new module for the&nbsp;german localization of OpenCms&nbsp;available. 6.0
RC&nbsp;2 also contains numerous fixes applied since 6.0 RC 1. We are
confident that this second release candidate is pretty stable, since
the 6.0 beta versions are already used successfully in quite a lot
of "live" installations.</p>
<p><strong>Who should use this 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 version?</strong></p>
<p>In this release candidate, the core features of OpenCms are
completed, and should run stable. Until the final release, there
will only be GUI changes in the Workplace and other frontend
releated improvements.<br >
</p>
<p> We believe that this 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 version is stable enough
to be used in a production system. It's likely to be more stable
than the current "stable" 5.0.1 release.</p>
<p>If and how you should use this version depends on what your
goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are starting a new OpenCms project, you should 
  use this 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 and not 5.0.1.</li><li>If you are currently using any previous 6.0 
  development release (e.g. 6.0 alpha 1, 2, 3 , beta 1, 2, 3 or RC 1), you 
  should upgrade to this new version in case you have encountered issues with 
  the release you are using. If this is not the case, you may as well wait until 
  the 6.0 final release is out.</li><li>If you are running a website based on OpenCms 5.0.1, and you
want to upgrade, you should wait until the final 6.0 release is
available.<br >
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When will the "final" release of OpenCms 6.0 be
available?</strong></p>
<p>June 30, 2005. You can help speeding up the process of
development by providing feedback for this release and the
following releases, especially regarding bugs. In case you find any
bug, please use the <a target="_self" href="${link0}">OpenCms bugzilla</a> to document
it, or at least post a note to the <A href="${link1}" target=_self>opencms-dev</A> mailing list. The more feedback and code
contributions are made, the faster we can fix the issues and finish
the development.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple websites can now be managed in one OpenCms

  features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources</li><li>Implement new, cleaned up XmlPage API that replaces 
  the old XmlTemplate for page data storage</li><li>The XmlPage structure is always validated by a W3C XML 
  Schema, to prevent creation of invalid content</li><li>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required</li><li>The OpenCms VFS has been made much more scalable, 
  bottlenecks like the slow Explorer tree have been removed</li><li>The OpenCms user management has been made independent

</ul>
<p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.0 is
released:</strong></p>
<UL>
<li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required!</li></UL>
<p><strong>Regarding backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 is largely backward compatible with the 5.x releases.
Existing content from 5.x is easily importable, automatically
converted to the new XML page format and requires almost no manual
modification - at least if you didn't somehow change the structure
of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page files.</p>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that break existing 5.0 code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes is
necessary in order to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious is the
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work is most often just a matter of exchanging these
import statements and some minor adjustments. Please refer to the
Alkacon Documentation regarding the details of the upgrade process
from 5.0.x to 6.0.<br >
</p>
<p><strong>Regarding support for XmlTemplates and the "Master
Module"</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 does have support for legacy XmlTemplates, but only
with an additional <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> that is not longer
part of the core and requires the installation of an additional
module. All classes dealing with XmlTemplates will stay in the
com.opencms.* packages where they are now. We consider XmlTemplate
a "dead" technology and will not support it past the 6.0
release.<br >
</p>
<p>The "master module" technology of 5.0.x has been replaced by the
new XmlContent mechanism. Therefore all database tables that are
used for the master module and some others (like the "webusers"
table) have also been moved to a separate module
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> that installs these
tables if required.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding version numbers and CVS build
tags</strong></p>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, 
please keep the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6 release 
candidates are "build_5_9_x", e.g. 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 is "build_5_9_2". Until we 
finally publish OpenCms 6, we will continue to use 5.x as internal CVS build tag 
numbers. 6 alpha had CVS build tags 5.5.x, the 6 beta did use 5.7.x.
</p>
<p><strong>Regarding compatibility with other JVMs / Servlet
containers / Databases</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x It won't work
with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK.
However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.* packages
that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory run with
all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p> We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and
to some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.0 RC&nbsp;2 works "out of the box"
with Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of
Xerces is required like in OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported
deploying 6.0 development versions successfully on other servlet
containers like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL
4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed as
well thanks to Antonio Core, but we at Alkacon have not tested it.
The MS SQL Server and the SAP DB port have not been updated to
OpenCms 6.0 so far, and we still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
"supported platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these
so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome.
Please contact <A href="${link2}">contributions@opencms.org</A> in
case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms 6,
or give your feedback on the <A href="${link3}" target=_self>opencms-dev</A> mailing list.</p>
