      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Release Notes for OpenCms 7.0.5</h1>
<p>July 2, 2008: This is the release of OpenCms 7.0.5. This version adds a number of improvements to the OpenCms core as well as the modules shipped with the core by default.</p>
<p>Most notably in this release is the updated OpenCms demo website created with the new &quot;TemplateTwo&quot;. Both the demo and the template are a big step forward compared to the previous &quot;TemplateOne&quot;. &quot;TemplateOne&quot; still is available but not longer installed by default.</p>
<p>Moreover, the &quot;Direct Edit&quot; function has been improved greatly. The positioning of the direct edit buttons now is much more precise, especially for CSS based layouts. Plus the look of the direct edit highlighting on the web page has been enhanced.</p>
<p>A ton of other additions and improvements tops off this release. Of course, OpenCms 7.0.5 also fixes a number of issues that persisted in 7.0.3. See below for more details.</p>

    <li>JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4 are now used by default.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.5 is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.0.x versions. We recommend everyone who uses an earlier version of OpenCms to update to the 7.0.5 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7 is largely backward compatible with version 6. Most templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 6 should work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 7. A number of API methods from OpenCms 6 have been marked as &quot;deprecated&quot;. In case you have made extensive use of OpenCms internal classes and APIs from version 6, there may be some changes required in your code. However, in most cases this should not take longer than a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Please note that since OpenCms 7 uses JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4 standards by default, you may have to change that back to JSP 1.2 / Servlet 2.3 so your existing OpenCms JSP templates from OpenCms 6 run without change. You must edit the &quot;web-app&quot; node in the OpenCms web.xml file to do that.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It works well with Java 1.4 using the optional &quot;Java 1.4 compatibility package&quot;. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and Websphere. We appreciate any feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and 7.4.x, MS SQL Server 2000 / 2003, DB2 9.1 and HSQLDB 1.8.0. The automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7 supports MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 7 final releases are &quot;build_7_0_x&quot;, so the 7.0.5 release is tagged &quot;build_7_0_5&quot;. Development of maintenance releases (like 7.0.5) is currently done in CVS HEAD.</p>
