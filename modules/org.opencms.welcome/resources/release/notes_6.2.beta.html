      <content><![CDATA[<h1>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.2 beta</h1><p>February 9, 2006: This is the public binary BETA release of OpenCms 6.2. OpenCms 6.2 is a major upgrade, and it includes several new features and improvements over OpenCms 6.0.x. We are confident that this beta release is pretty stable, since 6.2 is already used successfully in quite a lot of &quot;live&quot; installations.</p><p><strong>Who should use this 6.2 beta version?</strong></p><p>This is a beta version. Please don't expect it to be perfectly stable.<br /></p><p>Having said that, we believe that this 6.2 beta version is certainly stable enough to be used in a production system. It's likely to be more stable than the current &quot;stable&quot; 6.0.4 release. <br /></p><p>If and how you should use this version depends on what your goals are:</p><ul><li>If you starting a new OpenCms project, you should use this 6.2 beta and not 6.0.4. </li><li>If you are running a website based on OpenCms 6.0.4, and you want to upgrade, you should wait until the final 6.2 release is available.<br /></li></ul><p><strong>When will the &quot;final&quot; release of OpenCms 6.2 be available?</strong></p><p>End of Q1 2006.<br /></p><p>You can help speeding up the process of development by providing feedback for this release and the following releases, especially regarding bugs. In case you find any bug, please use the <a target="_self" href="${link0}">OpenCms bugzilla</a> to document it, or at least post a note to the <a target="_self" href="${link1}">opencms-dev</a> mailing list. The more feedback and code contributions are made, the faster we can fix the issues and finish the development.</p><h2>The most important new features in this beta release compared to the 6.0.4 version:</h2><p><strong>Support of new database versions</strong> </p><ul><li>MySQL 5.0.x </li><li>Oracle 10g </li></ul><p><strong>Administration improvements and new features</strong></p><ul><li>Enhanced Search tool interface for easier search index management </li><li>New Content check tool to validate file contents and properties </li><li>New project file list </li><li>New option to export webuser data </li><li>New option to export a folder recursively or not </li><li>All list displays in the Administration backoffice offer a print version </li><li>Project resources can now be modified in the project management &quot;Edit project&quot; dialog </li></ul><p><strong>Additional improvements and new features</strong></p><ul><li>New file history dialog interface that is able to compare and make a 'diff' of xml pages and xml content including content, properties and file attributes</li><li>Added new ImageLoader with image processing and scaling capabilities</li><li>New frontend module to display photo albums conveniently on a website</li><li>Multi resource selection in explorer view for simultaneous VFS operations on the selected resources, e.g. for copying or moving resources </li><li>Added &lt;cms:decorate&gt; tag for parsing and decorating HTML content</li><li>In the Explorer view, it is&nbsp;now possible to select resources by right-clicking on the resource name </li><li>The Explorer tree view now shows the resource state for new and changed resources </li><li>It is&nbsp;now possible to select 'individual' or 'shared' property mappings for XML content </li><li>Workplace explorer resources to display can now be configured using a Collector </li><li>Added &quot;before publish&quot; event </li></ul><p><strong>Resolved Issues</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed issue #514 &amp; #937: new 'Database Connection Validation' dialog added to setup wizard </li><li>Fixed issue #1006: it&nbsp; is now possible to use 3 letter locales (e.g. like &quot;ast&quot;) </li><li>Fixed issue #1020: undo changes now also works with shared properties </li><li>Fixed issue #1021: file parameter of the cms:property and cms:decorate tag is always toLowerCase() </li><li>Fixed issue #1024: parent group is shown correctly in the group overview </li><li>Fixed issue #1027: new folder permissions test added to setup wizard </li><li>Fixed issue with removing temporary flag after editing content </li><li>Fixed issue with linebreaks in HTML-Converter </li><li>Fixed issue in locale handler if non-existant resource has been requested </li><li>Fixed issue in FlexController that sometimes caused NPE errors during system startup </li></ul><p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.2 is released:</strong></p><ul><li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required! </li></ul><p><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Please note: </span>The development of JMX for OpenCms and the Content Relationship Engine (CRE), both features initially intended for the 6.2 release, will not make it in the 6.2 release. We hope to add these features in a later version.<br /></p><h2>Backward compatibility</h2><p>OpenCms 6.2 should be highly backward compatible with 6.0.x versions. Certain bug fixes required minor API changes so some adjustments may have to be made for code that uses more advanced API functions such as custom resource types. All Templates should be backward compatible without changes. </p><p>To upgrade an existing OpenCms 6.0.x to the new 6.2 release, we will provide an upgrade wizard just for the final 6.2 release. We will not provide a wizard for this OpenCms 6.2 beta release. To upgrade, you should back up your modules and contents and do a fresh installation of the 6.2 beta release.</p><p>In case you are using one of the previous development versions (OpenCms 6 alpha, beta or release candidates), there have been a lot of issues fixed so you should definitely update. If you still use OpenCms 5.0.x, you should also update since the final 6.2 version will be much more advanced and stable.</p><h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2><p>OpenCms 6.2 beta requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p><p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to some extend on JBoss 4.0. OpenCms 6.2 beta works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. Others have reported deploying 6.0.x versions successfully on other servlet containers like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p><p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1.x, MySQL 5.0.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed thanks to Antonio Core. maxDB support has been contributed thanks to Clovis Wichoski and Fabiano Rech. MS SQL server support&nbsp; has been contributed thanks to Andras Balogh. We still are looking for volunteers to support testing the stability of the PostgreSQL, maxDB and MS SQL server releases.<br /></p><p>In case you run OpenCms 6.2 beta on components different from our default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x / MySQL 4.0.x, 4.1.x or 5.0.x / Oracle 9.x or Oracle 10.x), please let us know by posting a message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of &quot;supported platforms&quot;. Also, if you had to patch some lines of code to make OpenCms 6.2 beta run on your platforms, please contribute these so they can be included in the official release.</p><h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2><p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS tag for the 6.2 release is &quot;build_6_1_8&quot;. Development of further bug fix releases is done in CVS &quot;dev_6_0_1&quot; branch. </p><p>You can check out the current development version by selecting the &quot;dev_6_0_1&quot; branch of the CVS. Until we finally publish OpenCms 6.2, we will continue to use 6.1.x as internal CVS build tag numeration.</p><h2>How you can help</h2><p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome. Please contact <a href="${link2}">contributions@opencms.org</a> in case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms 6, or give your feedback on the <a target="_self" href="${link3}">opencms-dev</a> mailing list.</p><p>Please use our Bugzilla to report bugs in this release: <a target="extern" href="${link4}">http://www.opencms.org/bugzilla/<br /></a></p><p>Thank you for using OpenCms and have fun with OpenCms 6.2 beta :-)</p>]]></content>
