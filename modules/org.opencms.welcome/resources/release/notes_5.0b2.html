      <content><![CDATA[<h2>Release Notes for OpenCms 5.0 beta 2</h2><p>11/11/2002: This version is a major step towards the final release of OpenCms 5. It adds a number of important features especially for the JSP integration and caching mechanism. The most visible change from previous versions is the new structure of the OpenCms workplace in the virtual file system (VFS), which now has a much more streamlined directory layout. A long list of minor enhancements and fixes completes this release. </p><p>OpenCms 5.0 beta 2 is Open Source software published under the LGPL license. </p><p>The OpenCms 5.0 beta 2 includes all features from the last &quot;major&quot; release 4.6.1, the FLEX alpha 1, the 4.7.7 version and of course the 5.0 beta 1. It's at last as stable as all of these earlier versions. I encourage everyone to try this version and provide feedback on the opencms-dev mailing list. </p><p>OpenCms 5.0 beta 2 supports Java 1.4. and 1.4.1. Because of required features related to file encoding and JDBC we recommend not using earlier releases of Java. </p><p>The almost complete list of changes and improvements in OpenCms 5.0 beta 2:</p><ul><li>JSP now support nested includes with XMLTemplates </li><li>The JSP cms:include tag functionality has been extended, the include target can now be set from a property, from an expression in the tag's body or from a request attribute </li><li>More new and improved JSP tags for easier template development </li><li>Exception handling in JSP now directly points to the problem (even if it is in an included element) </li><li>The FlexCache for caching of JSP now implements a LRU policy and can be fully configured in the opencms.properties </li><li>A new class com.opencms.flex.jsp.CmsJspActionBean provides access to the OpenCms taglibs features through JSP scriplet code </li><li>The new, streamlined 5.0 workplace directory layout is in place </li><li>The new &quot;directory translation&quot; feature allows setting resource name translation rules in opencms.properties for backward compatibility </li><li>The &quot;file name translation&quot; feature automatically replaces illegal characters (e.g. space, ?
