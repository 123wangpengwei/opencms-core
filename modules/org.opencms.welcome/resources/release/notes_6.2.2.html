<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses an earlier version of OpenCms to update to this 6.2.2 release. In
case you are using one of the previous versions (OpenCms 6.0.x, 6.2 beta, 6.2.0&nbsp;or 6.2.1),
there have been several issues fixed in this 6.2.2 release. If you still use OpenCms 5.0.x, you
should definitely consider an update since the 6.2 version is much more advanced and stable.</p>
<p>OpenCms 6.2.2 should be highly backward compatible with all 6.0 versions. Certain minor API
changes have been made, so some adjustments may have to be done for code that uses more advanced
API functions. All Templates should be backward compatible without changes.</p>
<p>To upgrade an existing OpenCms 6.0.x, 6.2 beta, 6.2.0&nbsp;or 6.2.1&nbsp;to the new 6.2.2 final
release, an easy to use upgrade wizard is provided.
<br /></p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 6.2 requires Java 1.4.x or Java 1.5.x. It won't work with Java 1.3.x. We have tested
only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it
should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine and to some extend on JBoss 4.0.
OpenCms 6.2 works "out of the box" with Tomcat 5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. Others have reported
deploying 6.x versions successfully on other servlet containers like BEA Weblogic and SunONE.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0, MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.0, Oracle 9.x and Oracle
10.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed thanks to Antonio Core and Ivan Codarin. maxDB
support has been contributed thanks to Clovis Wichoski and Fabiano Rech. MS SQL server support has
been contributed thanks to Andras Balogh. We still are looking for volunteers to support testing
the stability of the PostgreSQL, maxDB and MS SQL server releases.
<br /></p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS
tag for the 6.2.2 release is "build_6_2_2". Development of the next OpenCms release is done in the
"DEV_7_0" branch. Upcoming development version will use the version numbers 6.3.x for the next time
and will be likewise tagged in the CVS.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>

development team on the 
<a target="_self" href="${link0}">opencms-dev</a> mailing list in
