</ul>
<h2>Backward compatibility with version 6</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses an earlier version of OpenCms to update to the 7.0.0 release. In
case you are using one of the previous development versions (OpenCms&nbsp;7 alpha, beta or release
candidates), there have been a lot of issues fixed in the final release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 features&nbsp;is largely&nbsp;backward compatible with version 6. Most templates
and other OpenCms developed code from version 6 should work "out of the box" with version 7. A
number of API methods from OpenCms 6 have been marked as "deprecated". In case you have made
extensive use of OpenCms internal classes and APIs from version 6, there may be some changes
required in your code. However, in most cases this should not take longer than a couple of
hours.</p>
<p>Please note that since OpenCms 7 uses JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4 standards by default, you may have
to change that back to JSP 1.2 / Servlet 2.3 so your existing OpenCms JSP templates run without
change. You must edit the "web-app" node in the OpenCms web.xml file to do that.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It works well with Java 1.4
using the optional "Java 1.4 compatibility package". It won't work with Java 1.3. We have tested
only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it
should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms 7.0.0 works "out of the box"
with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying 7.0.0 development versions
successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and Websphere. We appreciate any feedback
regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as
well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and 7.4.x. The automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7 supports MySQL and
Oracle.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS
tag numbers&nbsp;for all OpenCms 7&nbsp;final&nbsp;releases&nbsp;are "build_7_0_x", so the 7.0.0
release is tagged "build_7_0_0". Development of maintenance releases (like 6.2.3) is currently done
in CVS HEAD. OpenCms&nbsp;7 alpha had CVS build tags 6.5.x, the&nbsp;6 beta did use 6.7.x, and
the&nbsp;7 RC had 6.9.x.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
