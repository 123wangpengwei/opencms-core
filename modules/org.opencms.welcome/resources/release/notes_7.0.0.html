<h2>Backward compatibility with version 6</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 7.0.0 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 features&nbsp;is highly backward compatible with version 6. Most templates and
other OpenCms developed code from version 6 should work "out of the box" with version 7. A number
of API methods from OpenCms 6 have been marked as "deprecated". In case you have made extensive use
of OpenCms internal classes and APIs from version 6, there may be some changes required in your
code. However, in most cases this should not take longer than a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Please note that since OpenCms 7 uses JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4 standards by default, you may have
to change that back to JSP 1.2 / Servlet 2.3 so your existing OpenCms JSP templates run without
change. You must edit the "web-app" node in the OpenCms web.xml file to do that.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It works well with Java 1.4
using the optional "Java 1.4 compatibility package". It won't work with Java 1.3. We have tested
only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it
should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms 7.0.0 works "out of the box"
with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying 7.0.0 development versions
successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and Websphere. We appreciate any feedback
regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as
well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and 7.4.x and MS SQL Server 2000 and 2005. The automatic update wizard for
OpenCms 7.0.0 currently supports MySQL and Oracle.</p>
