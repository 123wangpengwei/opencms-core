<br /></h1>
<p>Mai 2, 2007: This is the public release of OpenCms 7 RC 1 (aka 6.9.1). OpenCms 7 is a major
upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms 6.</p>
<h2>
<strong>Features of the OpenCms 7 RC 1 release</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The internal link management has been greatly improved.</li>
<li>If files (or folders) are moved / renamed, all links to these files are now kept intact.</li>
<li>Deleting a resource that is linked by other resources does now display a warning / confirmation
dialog.</li>
<li>The new "Content Relationship Engine" (CRE) allows defining arbitrary relations between OpenCms
resources.</li>
<li>Native support for WebDAV access to the OpenCms VFS has been added.</li>
<li>Publishing of resources is now done using a queue, so a user can continue to work after
publishing has started.</li>
<li>The concept of "Organization Units" (OUs) has been added to the internal user management.</li>
<li>System permissions are now based on a complete new set of "Roles".</li>
<li>It is now possible to delegate management of users / groups in OUs to Sub-Administrators.</li>
<li>A "switch user" (su) function for Administrators in the OpenCms Workplace is now
available.</li>
<li>Many usability improvements for the OpenCms Workplace have been made, especially concerning the
handling of other users locks.</li>
<li>Many dialogs in the OpenCms Workplace are more responsive because of the use of Ajax
technologies.</li>
<li>The context menus in the Workplace are now cascading and can be configured individually based
on the users permissions.</li>
<li>A new "Undelete" function is available on the context menu to restore deleted resources,
including complete deleted subtrees.</li>
<li>The full text search has been greatly improved so that individual resource properties or fields
from XML content can be searched directly.</li>
<li>A "time warp" feature in the Workplace now allows users to view resources with date expired /
date released settings.</li>
<li>Auto correction for structured XML contents now allows changes to the XML schema of existing
resources.</li>
<li>A configurable search tool is now available for content managers in the Workplace.</li>
<li>A "permalink" handler for resources is available for external references in case a resource is
moved or renamed.</li>
<li>Link management support has been added in editors for standard HTML tags 'area', 'object' &amp;
'embed'.</li>
<li>The core database structure has been optimized.</li>
<li>JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4 are now used by default.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backward compatibility with version 6</h2>OpenCms 7 RC 1 has not been optimized for backward
compatibility with version 6 yet. We are most interested in feedback regarding backwards
compatibility to OpenCms 6.2, since we want to improve the 7 API to be as compatible as possible.
In the development process of OpenCms 7, several API methods where refactored - please let us know
what methods from version 6.2 we should put back in the API, these will then be marked as
deprecated. 
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7 RC 1 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It works well with Java 1.4
using the optional "Java 1.4 compatibility package". It won't work with Java 1.3. We have tested
only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it
should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms 7 RC 1 works "out of the box"
with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Testing for other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and
Websphere has yet to be done for OpenCms 7. We appreciate any feedback regarding other servlet
containers.
<br /></p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0, MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.0, Oracle 9.x and Oracle
10.x. Support for other DBs still needs to be updated for OpenCms 7.
<br /></p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the following in mind: The CVS
tag for the 7 RC 1 release is "build_7rc_1". Development of maintenance releases (like 6.2.3) is
currently done in CVS HEAD. Development of the next major OpenCms 7.0 release is done in the
"DEV_7_0" branch.
<br /></p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>

development team on the 
<a target="_self" href="%(link0)">opencms-dev</a> mailing list in
