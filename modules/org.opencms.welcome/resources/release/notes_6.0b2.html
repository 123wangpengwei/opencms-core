      <content><![CDATA[<h2>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0 beta 1<br >
</h2>
<p> 03/31/2005: This is the second public binary BETA release
of OpenCms 6.0. OpenCms 6.0 is a major upgrade, and it vastly
expands the features of OpenCms 5.0. The beta&nbsp;2 features the first look of
the new OpenCms "Administration" view. It also contains numerous fixes applied since 6.0 beta 1. We are confident that this second
beta release is pretty stable, since 6.0 is already used
successfully in quite a lot of "live" installations.</p>
<p><strong>Who should use this 6.0 beta&nbsp;2 version?</strong></p>
<p>This is a beta version. Please don't expect it to be perfectly
stable.<br >
</p>
<P> Having said that, we believe that this 6.0 beta&nbsp;2 version is
certainly stable enough to be used in a production system. It's
likely to be more stable than the current "stable" 5.0.1 release.
The main reason for still being in "beta" status is that we want to
fully re-write the Workplace "Administration" view before we
announce 6.0 as finished.<br ></P>
<P>If and how you should use this version depends on what your goals are:</P>
<ul>
<li>If you starting a new OpenCms project, you should use 
  this 6.0 beta&nbsp;2 and not 5.0.1. 
  
</li><li>If you are currently using any previous 6.0 
  development release (e.g. 6.0 alpha 1, 2, 3 or beta 1), you should upgrade to 
  this new version in case you have encountered issues with the release you are 
  using. If this is not the case, you may as well wait until the 6.0 final 
  release is out.
  </li><LI>If you are running a website based on OpenCms 5.0.1, and you
want to upgrade, you should wait until the final 6.0 release is
available.<br 
  ></LI>
</ul>
<p><strong>When will the "final" release of OpenCms 6.0 be
available?</strong></p>
<p>End of Q2 2005. I promise this is the last delay and time the
release date is for real!<br >
</p>
<p>You can help speeding up the process of development by providing
feedback for this release and the following releases, especially
regarding bugs. In case you find any bug, please use the <a href="${link0}" target="_self">OpenCms
bugzilla</a> to document it, or at least post a note to the <A href="${link1}" target=_self>opencms-dev</a> mailing list.
The more feedback and code contributions are made, the faster we
can fix the issues and finish the development.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>The most important new features in this release compared
to the 5.0.x version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple websites can now be managed in one OpenCms 
  installation 
  
</li><li>The "Direct Edit" feature allows users to open the 
  editor directly from the websites front-end by pushing an "Edit" button that 
  appears on elements on the page (if the user has the permissions to edit it) 
  
</li><li>Using the new resource type "XmlContent", building 
  structured content (e.g. news articles, product descriptions etc.) is really 
  easy and requires little or no programming 
  
</li><li>OpenCms now comes with a highly configurable template 
  with many advanced functions as additional default module 
  
</li><li>Multi-language versions of the same page and improved 
  support for managing multi language websites is integrated 
  
</li><li>Build-in support for full text search in HTML, PDF, 
  Word, Excel and Plaintext documents (based on Apache Lucene) 
  
</li><li>All contents in the VFS can now have a "publication 
  date" and an "expiration date" so they can appear / disappear automatically 
  from a website 
  
</li><li>Resource permissions in the VFS are now managed in 
  ACLs instead of Unix - style 
  
</li><li>The OpenCms workplace has been rewritten in JSP, 
  adding new features and much improved usability (this task is not fully 
  finished) 
  
</li><li>All new, much more user friendly "Administration" 
  pages (this task is not fully finished) 
  
</li><li>Full support for multibyte languages (e.g. UTF-8) 
  
</li><li>Files in the VFS can now have multiple "siblings", 
  this is comparable to a "hard link" in a Unix file system and prevents broken 
  "VFS links" automatically 
  
</li><li>Properties on files can be "individual" or "shared" 
  among siblings 
  
</li><li>Implement "plugin" mechanism for editors and make 
  editors more configurable, so that other editor implementations (e.g. WYSIWYG 
  Java Applet) can be easily integrated in the workplace 
  
</li><li>Added optional WYSIWYG editor implementation of the 
  popular HtmlArea editor, this editor also works with Mozilla browsers 
  
</li><li>The setup wizard has been improved, also many "known 
  issues" (e.g. regarding encoding setting and Xerces version) have been fixed 
  
</li><li>The module API has been rewritten from the ground up, 
  now providing a clean interface to implement 
  
</li><li>Optimized the use of http headers, including use of 
  "304 - not modified" for resources that have not been modified 
  
</li><li>The resource type API has been enhanced, so that 
  resource types can be easily added without workarounds 
  
</li><li>The Workplace is now fully usable with Mozilla based 
  browsers (e.g. Firefox) 
  
</li><li>It's not longer required to "lock" a resource in the 
  Explorer with the context menu manually, this is done automatically if the 
  "autolock" feature is enabled (this is also the default) 
  
</li><li>The static export has been fully rewritten, is also 
  features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources 
  
</li><li>Implement new, cleaned up XmlPage API that replaces 
  the old XmlTemplate for page data storage 
  
</li><li>The XmlPage structure is always validated by a W3C 
  XML Schema, to prevent creation of invalid content 
  
</li><li>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required 
  
</li><li>The OpenCms VFS has been made much more scalable, 
  bottlenecks like the slow Exlorer tree have been removed 
  
</li><li>The OpenCms user management has been made independent 
  from the OpenCms VFS, so that other user directories can be "plugged" into the 
  system as a separate module 
  
</li><li>Publishing has been rewritten and is now much faster 
  especially with many resources 
  
</li><li>All resources in the OpenCms VFS now have a UUID 
  
</li><li>The database pooling has been replaced with DBCP from 
  Apache Jakarta 
  
</li><li>All known issues with Oracle 9.x that were present in 
  5.0.x have been solved 
  
</li><li>Logging now uses log4j from Apache Jarkarta 
  
</li><li>Heavily modified the database model and completely 
  rewrote the database access class layer 
  
</li><li>The configuration is now based on a new XML structure 
  that is read by Apache Digester (this task is not fully finished) 
  
</li><li>UTF-8 is now the default encoding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.0 is
released:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The rest of the "Administration" view is to be 
  re-implemented in the new tool API 
  
</li><li>Write documentation how to update from 5.0 to 6.0<br 
  >
</li><li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Please note: </span>The development of JMX for OpenCms and the Content
Relationship Engine (CRE), both features initially intended for
the 6.0 release, will not make it in the 6.0 release. We hope to add these features in a later version.<br ></p>
<p><strong>Regarding backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will be as backward compatible as possible with the
5.x releases. Existing content from 5.x will be easily importable,
automatically converted to the new format and require almost no
manual modification - at least if you didn't somehow change the
structure of the XML control code of the 5.0.x page files.</p>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that will break existing code.
This means changes of Java code in templates or custom classes will
be necessary to upgrade from 5.x to 6. Most obvious will be
renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to org.opencms.*. Making
existing code work will hopefully be just a matter of exchanging
these import statements and some minor adjustments.</p>
<p>We will try to provide a more detailed documentation for the
upgrade procedure from 5.0 to 6.0 as part of a later release. This
is on the TODO list.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding support for XmlTemplates and the "Master
Module"</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will have support for legacy XmlTemplates, but only
with an additional <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> that will not be
installed by default. All classes dealing with XmlTemplates will
stay in the com.opencms.* packages where they are now. We consider
XmlTemplate a "dead" technology and will not support it past the
6.0 release.</p>
<p>The "master module" technology of 5.0.x will be replaced by the
new XmlContent mechanism. Therefore all database tables that are
used for the master module and some others (like the "webusers"
table) have been moved to a separate module
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> that installs these
tables if required.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding version numbers and CVS build
tags</strong></p>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep
the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 6
beta releases are "build_5_7_x", e.g. 6.0 beta 1 is "build_5_7_1".
Until we finally publish OpenCms 6, we will continue to use 5.x as
internal CVS build tag numbers. 6 alpha had CVS build tags 5.5.x,
the 6 beta now uses 5.7.x, and 6 release candidates will use
5.9.x.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding compatibility with other JVMs / Servlet
containers / Databases</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6.0 beta 1 requires Java 1.4.x. or Java 1.5.x. It won't
work with Java 1.3.x. We have tested only with SUNs version of the
JDK. However, we have removed the dependencies from all sun.*
packages that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it should in theory
run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release only on the Tomcat servlet engine.
OpenCms 6.0 beta 1 works "out of the box" with Tomcat 4.1.x, Tomcat
5.0.x and Tomcat 5.5.x. No replacing of Xerces is required like in
OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported deploying 6.0 development versions successfully on other servlet containers like BEA
Weblogic, SunONE and JBoss.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL
4.1.x and Oracle 9.x. PostgresSQL support has been contributed as
well thanks to Antonio Core, but we at Alkacon have not tested it.
The MS SQL Server and the SAP DB port have not been updated to
OpenCms 6.0 so far, and we still need volunteers for this task.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0 on components different from our
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x, 5.0.x or 5.5.x /
MySQL 4.0.x or 4.1.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a
message to the OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of
"supported platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code
to make OpenCms 6.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these
so they can be included in the official release.</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome.
Please contact <A href="${link2}">contributions@opencms.org</a> in
case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms 6,
or give your feedback on the <A href="${link3}" target=_self>opencms-dev</a> mailing
list.</p>
<p>Please use our Bugzilla to report bugs in this release: <a href="${link4}" target="_self">http://www.opencms.org/bugzilla/</a></p>
