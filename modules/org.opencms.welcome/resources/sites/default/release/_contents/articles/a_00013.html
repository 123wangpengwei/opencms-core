        <content><![CDATA[<p>July 11, 2007: This is the release of OpenCms 7.0.1. OpenCms 7 is a  major upgrade, and it vastly expands the features of OpenCms 6. Version  7.0.1 is a bugfix release that fixes a critical issue present in the  first 7.0.0 release, as well as a number of other issues.</p>

<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses an earlier version of OpenCms to  update to the 7.0.1 release. OpenCms 7.0.0 has a critical bug that makes  it impossible to apply permissions to resources outside the /system/  folder. In case you are using one of the previous versions (OpenCms 7  alpha, beta or release candidates), there have been a lot of issues  fixed in the final release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7 is largely backward compatible with version 6. Most  templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 6 should work  &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 7. A number of API methods from OpenCms 6  have been marked as &quot;deprecated&quot;. In case you have made extensive use of  OpenCms internal classes and APIs from version 6, there may be some  changes required in your code. However, in most cases this should not  take longer than a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Please note that since OpenCms 7 uses JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4  standards by default, you may have to change that back to JSP 1.2 /  Servlet 2.3 so your existing OpenCms JSP templates run without change.  You must edit the &quot;web-app&quot; node in the OpenCms web.xml file to do that.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It works  well with Java 1.4 using the optional &quot;Java 1.4 compatibility package&quot;.  It won't work with Java 1.3. We have tested only with SUNs version of  the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.* packages so it  should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms  7.0.1 works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others  have reported deploying 7 development versions successfully on other  servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and Websphere. We appreciate any  feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1,  MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and  7.4.x. The automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7 supports MySQL and  Oracle.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the  following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 7 final releases  are &quot;build_7_0_x&quot;, so the 7.0.1 release is tagged &quot;build_7_0_1&quot;.  Development of maintenance releases (like 7.0.1) is currently done in  CVS HEAD.</p>
