<h2>Backward compatibility with version 6</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 7.0.0 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 features&nbsp;is highly backward compatible with version 6.  Most templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 6 should  work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 7. A number of API methods from  OpenCms 6 have been marked as &quot;deprecated&quot;. In case you have made  extensive use of OpenCms internal classes and APIs from version 6, there  may be some changes required in your code. However, in most cases this  should not take longer than a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Please note that since OpenCms 7 uses JSP 2.0 and Servlet 2.4  standards by default, you may have to change that back to JSP 1.2 /  Servlet 2.3 so your existing OpenCms JSP templates run without change.  You must edit the &quot;web-app&quot; node in the OpenCms web.xml file to do that.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.0.0 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. It  works well with Java 1.4 using the optional &quot;Java 1.4 compatibility  package&quot;. It won't work with Java 1.3. We have tested only with SUNs  version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no dependencies to sun.*  packages so it should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms  7.0.0 works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others  have reported deploying 7.0.0 development versions successfully on  other servlet containers like JBoss, BEA and Websphere. We appreciate  any feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.1, MySQL 5.x,  Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and 7.4.x and MS  SQL Server 2000 and 2005. The automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7.0.0  currently supports MySQL and Oracle.</p>
