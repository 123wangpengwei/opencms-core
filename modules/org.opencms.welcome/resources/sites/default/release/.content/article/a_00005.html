<h2>Backward compatibility with version 7.0</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 7.5 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 7.5&nbsp; is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.0.x  versions. Most templates and other OpenCms developed code from version 7  should work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 7.5.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 7.5 has been written and tested using Java 1.5 / 1.6. We have  tested only with SUNs version of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no  dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all  compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms  works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 5.5, which we recommend. Others have  reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like  JBoss, BEA, Websphere and Resin Professional. We appreciate any  feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x, MySQL 4.1,  MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and  7.4.x, MS SQL Server 2000 / 2003, DB2 9.1 and HSQLDB 1.8.0. The  automatic update wizard for OpenCms 7 supports MySQL, Oracle and  PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the  following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 7.5 final  releases are &quot;build_7_5_x&quot;, so the 7.5.0 release is tagged  &quot;build_7_5_0&quot;. Development of maintenance releases is currently done in  CVS HEAD.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>Contributions to the OpenCms core development are most welcome. Please contact the core development team on the <a href="%(link0)">opencms-dev</a> mailing list in case you are interested in supporting the development of OpenCms.</p>
<p>Please use our Bugzilla to report bugs in this release: <a href="%(link1)">http://bugzilla.opencms.org/<br />

<p>Thank you for using OpenCms and have fun with OpenCms 7.5 :-)</p>]]></content>
