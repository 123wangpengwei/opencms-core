<h2>Backward compatibility</h2>
<p>We recommend everyone who uses OpenCms to update to the 8.0.0 release.</p>
<p>OpenCms 8 is fully backward compatible to all prior 7.x versions. Templates and other OpenCms developed code from version  7.0 or 7.5 should work &quot;out of the box&quot; with version 8.</p>
<p>Users of the Alkacon OCEE packages require a new version of Alkacon  OCEE for use with this OpenCms release. OpenCms 8 requires  Alkacon OCEE version 3 or newer.</p>
<h2>Compatibility with Java versions, Servlet containers and Databases</h2>
<p>OpenCms 8.0 has been written and tested using Java 5 / 6. We have  tested only with SUNs version (well actually it's ORACLEs version now) of the JDK. However, OpenCms has no  dependencies to sun.* packages so it should in theory run with all  compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms  works &quot;out of the box&quot; with Tomcat 6.0, which we recommend. Others have  reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like  JBoss, BEA, Websphere, Glassfish and Resin Professional. We appreciate  any feedback regarding other servlet containers.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 5.x, Oracle 9.x and Oracle 10.x, as well as PostgreSQL 8.2.x and  7.4.x, MS SQL Server 2000 / 2003, DB2 9.1 and HSQLDB 1.8.0. The  automatic update wizard for OpenCms 8 supports MySQL, Oracle and  PostgreSQL.</p>
<h2>Regarding version numbers and CVS build tags</h2>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms from the CVS, please keep the  following in mind: The CVS tag numbers for all OpenCms 8.0 releases are &quot;build_8_0_x&quot;, so the 8.0.0 release is tagged  &quot;build_8_0_0&quot;. Development of maintenance releases is currently done in  CVS HEAD.</p>
