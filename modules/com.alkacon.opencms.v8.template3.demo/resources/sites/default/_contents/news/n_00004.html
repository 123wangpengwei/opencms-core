        <content><![CDATA[<p>Rosenheim - Since August 1st, 2010, the common privet is anymore toxic. Rosenheimer scientists of the national botany department have discovered and manipulated the genetical code of the privet toxic. Through the scission of one oxygen atom, the scientists are able to detox the common privet.</p>
<div>So far, the common privet avoided that other plants could have settled in its environment. As the common privet is pretty popular as a hedge plant, so far it was impossible to settle other plants, respectively hedges, together with it.</div>
<div>The chairman of the botany association Germany, Heiner Rasen, regards this discovery as a milestone in the hedge planting. Now, the gardener has the possibility to set in different species for a georgeous hedge, to defy the uniform and dull view of a common privet hedge.</div>]]></content>
