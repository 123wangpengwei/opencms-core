        <content><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;On February 1, 2010 a new edition will released.</p>
<div>Jekka McVicar, expert herb grower and best-selling author, examines 50 flowers, with tips on how to grow them in your garden, or in containers, and when to harvest. Showing which parts of the flowers are the tastiest and which should be removed, Jekka provides at least 2 recipes for each flower. From Chamomile to Sweet Violets, the 100 recipes include such delights as Rosemary and Tomato Soup, Green Thai Chicken Curry with Citrus Flowers and Rice and Summer Pudding with Rose Acacia Flowers. There is also expert advice on the making of flower oils and vinegars, preserving flowers in the form of butter or sugar and drying them at a later stage.</div>
