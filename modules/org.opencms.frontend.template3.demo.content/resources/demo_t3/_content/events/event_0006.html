        <content><![CDATA[<p>2009 German Federal Horticultural Exhibition in Schwerin.</p>
<p>The 2009 German Federal Horticultural Exhibition in Schwerin will be a very special exhibition.&nbsp; Three features make it stand out from the history of our National Garden Festivals in Germany, which goes back more than 50 years.</p>
<p>Firstly, the show &ndash; which will run from 23rd April to 11th October 2009 &ndash; will focus on the historical development of garden construction and design from the 18th century to the present day.&nbsp; This means that the exhibition in Schwerin will be a National GARDEN Festival in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>Secondly, the BUGA in the capital city of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania will be a very compact show.All the exhibition areas are located around Schwerin Castle in the direct vicinity of the Old Town, with the result that the distances between the different areas will be kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>And thirdly, the gardens at the Schwerin show will be situated by the lake, thereby turning the face of the city towards the water. Since this is only true to a very limited extent at present, this aspect of the 2009 German Federal Horticultural Exhibition is also regarded as part of our Urban Development Plan.</p>]]></content>
