        <h2>1 Create a dump of your database</h2>
        Create a dump of your database. For mysql-databases you can call the following command:<br>
        <pre>mysqdump opencms > dump.sql</pre>
        </p>
        
        <hr></hr>
      
        <p>
        <h2>2 Patch your database for OpenCms from 4.7.9 to 4.7.10</h2>
		Alter the tables CMS_BACKUP_FILES and CMS_BACKUP_PROPERTIES with the statements in the file alter_table.sql.<br>
		For mysql-databases you can call the following command:<br>
		<pre>mysql opencms < alter_table.sql</pre>
		</p>

		<h2>3 ATTENTION! When using the new history feature for deleting old versions</h2>
		If you use the new history feature for deleting old versions in a patched system the first time you will lost ALL entries
		in the tables CMS_BACKUP_PROPERTIES and CMS_BACKUP_FILES that have no VERSION_ID. These versions were created before you have
		updated your system to OpenCms 4.7.10.<br>
		So you should not start to delete versions from the history before you want to delete all versions that were created with OpenCms 4.7.9 (or older).
