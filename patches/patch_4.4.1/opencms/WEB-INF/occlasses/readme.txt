Readme for moduledevelopers of OpenCms
######################################

In this folder (occlasses) you can store your OpenCms template and module-
classes. OpenCms will locate and load these classes automatically. You don't
need to reconfigure OpenCms. If you have created libraries (.jar) of your
classes you should store them in oclib.
