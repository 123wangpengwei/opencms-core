/**
 * Interface for OpenCms dump template classes.
 * <P>
 * All methods extending the functionality of the common
 * template class interface to the special behaviour
 * of dump template classes may be defined here.
 * <P>
 * Primarily, this interface is important for the loader, 
 * NOT for the template engine.
 * The CmsDumpLoader can load all templates that
 * implement the I_CmsDumpTemplate interface.
