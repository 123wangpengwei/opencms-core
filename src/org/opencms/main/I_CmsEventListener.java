/**
 * Implement this interface in case your class has to react 
 * to CmsEvents that are thrown by system.<p>
 * 
 * In order to recieve system events, your class must register with 
 * the OpenCms event mechanism. This can be done in the constructor of a class
 * like this:
 * <pre>
 * com.opencms.core.A_OpenCms.addCmsEventListener(this);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A typical implementation might look like this:
 * <pre>
 * public void cmsEvent(com.opencms.flex.CmsEvent event) {
 *     switch (event.getType()) {
 *         case com.opencms.flex.I_CmsEventListener.EVENT_PUBLISH_PROJECT:
 *         case com.opencms.flex.I_CmsEventListener.EVENT_CLEAR_CACHES:
 *             // do something
 *             break;
 *         case com.opencms.flex.I_CmsEventListener.EVENT_LOGIN_USER:
 *            // do something else
 *             break;
 *         }
 * }
 * </pre>
