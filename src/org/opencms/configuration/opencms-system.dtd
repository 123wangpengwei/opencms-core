# Version history settings.
# The OpenCms VFS keeps a version history for old versions of files.
# This is done as a binary 1:1 copy of the original file (i.e. no "diff").
# Because of this the database would grow very large if unlimited versions
# would be stored. The version history is enabled by default. You can
# enable / disable it with the "enabled" attribute. The "count" attribute
# controls the number of binary copies that are kept in the database per individual file. 
# If a file has more versions, the oldest binary content is deleted (you can not re-create this 
# version anymore). However, the basic information about the old version (i.e. who 
# did the publish etc.) is still kept in the database.
