 * Lucene document factory class for indexing data from a generic <code>{@link org.opencms.file.CmsResource}</code>.<p> 
 * 
 * Since the document type is generic, no content extraction is performed for the resource.
 * However, meta data from the properties and attributes of the resource are indexed.<p>
 * 
 * The class is useful for example to have images appear in the search result if the title of the image 
 * matched the search query. It's also used if no specific extraction method is available for a binary document type.<p>
