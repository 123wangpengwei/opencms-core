/**
 * HTML link validation of a Cms file is enabled if the file's resource type implements the 
 * interface I_CmsHtmlLinkValidatable. Cms files with resource types that do not implement 
 * this interface don't get validated on broken links for example when a project gets published. 
 * Thus, this interface serves to identify "validatable" Cms files in the OpenCms VFS.<p>
 * 
 * HTML links are considered as href attribs in anchor tags and src attribs in image tags.<p>
