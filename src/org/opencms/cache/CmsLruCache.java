/**
 * Implements an LRU (last recently used) cache.<p>
 * 
 * The idea of this cache to separate the caching policy from the data structure
 * where the cached objects are stored. The advantage of doing so is, that the CmsFlexLruCache
 * can identify the last-recently-used object in O(1), whereas you would need at least
 * O(n) to traverse the data structure that stores the cached objects. Second, you can
 * easily use the CmsFlexLruCache to get an LRU cache, no matter what data structure is used to
 * store your objects.
 * <p>
 * The cache policy is affected by the "costs" of the objects being cached. Valuable cache costs
 * might be the byte size of the cached objects for example.
 * <p>
 * To add/remove cached objects from the data structure that stores them, the objects have to
 * implement the methods defined in the interface I_CmsLruCacheObject to be notified when they
 * are added/removed from the CmsFlexLruCache.
