/**
 * This interface describes a resource loader for OpenCms, 
 * a class that can load a resource from the VFS, 
 * process it's contents and deliver the result to the user.<p>
 *
 * The I_CmsResourceLoader operates with Request and Response in 
 * much the same way as a standard Java web application.<p>
 * 
 * This interface uses a standard servlet
 * {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper} / {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponseWrapper}
 * that provide access to a special implementation of the {@link javax.servlet.RequestDispatcher}.
 * The handling of the output written to the response is done by this 
 * dispatcher. The results are then passed back to OpenCms which 
 * will deliver them to the requesting user.<p>
