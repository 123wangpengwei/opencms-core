\section{About the archived documentation}

We are currently in the process to shift the book documentation
into interactive documentation modules. During this process, the
content of the book documentation is generally revised and updated.

Not all sections of the book documentation are already available
as interactive documentation modules yet. OpenCms now supports more 
than one template mechanism, and we preach to use standard JSP templates 
instead of proprietary XML templates. Thus it would make little sense
to transform the documentation of the proprietary XML template mechanism 
into a documentation module. Instead, these chapters were moved into the
archive part of the book documentation, where we also fixed typos and 
updated system paths in the example.
