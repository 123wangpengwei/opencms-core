\section{The new documentation structure of OpenCms 5.0}

We have finally decided to eat our own dogfood and manage the contents of the documentation 
with our content management system.
So from version 5.0 onward, the documentaion will be maintained in the form of OpenCms 
interactive documentation modules.
These are content modules that you can install and read directly in OpenCms.
One of the big advantages is that this gives the reader an interactive documentation 
with a lot of working example code,
because everything can directly be checked out in the running system.
It's also easier to write the documentation that way.

It will take some time to shift all of the contents of this ``book" version to 
the content module form, so this document will likley be around for some time.
However, the new functionality of the 5.0 and following releases are not described here,
but only in the content modules.

Of course, if someone wants to contribute his time and do the work to 
put the interactive documentation modules back into this ``static" form, this is very much appreciated. 
On the other hand we would also appreciate if someone would make interactive documentation modules
from the parts of the book that are still described only in this static document.
Please send an email to {\em contributions@opencms.org} if you are interested in doing any of this.
