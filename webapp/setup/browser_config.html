<h1>OpenCms Browser Configuration</h1>

<h2>Configuration that applies to all browsers</h2>
<p>
The configuration instructions on this page apply when you set up a
browser to access the backoffice part of OpenCms. This is the part
where you can edit pages, create new pages, manage users etc. In
OpenCms this is called "the Workplace".
</p>

<p>
The OpenCms Workplace is a complex JavaScript application that also
makes use of popup windows. Session management is done with cookies.
</p><p>
This means for a client browser that needs access to the Workplace:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable JavaScript</li>
<li>Allow Popups</li>
<li>Enable Cookies</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Please note:</i> This configuration applies <i>only</i> for browsers that 
access the OpenCms Workplace directly. For the site build with OpenCms,
there are no restrictions on the browser, the requirements will 
depend only on the templates / html you use.<br>&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>Using the OpenCms integrated editors</h2>
<p>
The OpenCms Workplace offers a variety of editors.
The most common editors are for editing Html in a WYSIWYG mode,
and for editing source code of JSP, Html or Plain Text pages.
The OpenCms Workplace will automatically detect the browser you use,
which editors are available,
and give you the best editor known to work with your browser.
</p>
<p>
In case no WYSIWYG editor is available for your browser, you will
be presented a simple text editor only.
</p>
<p>
Please note that additional editors can be added as separate OpenCms modules.
If you do not find a suitable editor for your browser, 
check the module download section of <a href="http://www.opencms.org" target="_blank">http://www.opencms.org</a>.
