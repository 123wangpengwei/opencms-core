	<h2>You are almost finished!</h2>

	<h3>Please read these important browser configuration notes:</h3>
	<p>The configuration instructions on this page apply when you set
		up a browser to access the backoffice part of Alkacon OpenCms. This is
		the part where you can edit existing pages, create new pages, manage
		users etc. In OpenCms this is called "the Workplace".</p>

	<p>
		The OpenCms Workplace has been tested with <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Firefox</b>,
		<b>Internet Explorer</b> and <b>Safari</b> browsers (IE version 10 or
		newer). The Workplace is a complex JavaScript application that makes
		use of popup windows and cookies.
	</p>
	<p>This means for a browser that needs access to the Workplace:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Enable JavaScript</li>
		<li>Allow Popups</li>
		<li>Enable Cookies</li>
	</ul>

	<div style="display: flex; width: 100%;">
		<div class="o-logo-opencms" style="padding-right: 20px; align-self: center;"></div>
		<div style="flex: 1;">
			<i>Please note:</i> These configuration applies <i>only</i> for
			browsers that access the OpenCms Workplace directly. For the site
			build with Alkacon OpenCms, there are no restrictions on the browser.
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>Using the OpenCms integrated editors</h3>
	<p>The OpenCms Workplace offers a variety of editors. The most
		common editors are for editing Html in a WYSIWYG mode, and for editing
		source code of JSP, Html or Plain Text pages. The OpenCms Workplace
		will automatically detect the browser you use, which editors are
		available, and give you the best editor known to work with your
		browser.</p>
	<p>In case no WYSIWYG editor is available for your browser, you
		will be presented a simple text editor only.</p>
	<p>
		Please note that additional editors can be added as separate OpenCms
		modules. If you do not find a suitable editor for your browser, check
		the module download section of <a href="http://www.opencms.org"
			target="_blank">http://www.opencms.org</a>.
