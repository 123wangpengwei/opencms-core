      <content><![CDATA[<h2>Release Notes for OpenCms 6.0 alpha 2</h2>
<p>10/25/2004: This is the second public binary alpha release of
OpenCms 6.0. OpenCms 6.0 is a major upgrade, and it vastly expands
the features of OpenCms 5.0. The alpha 2 release improves certain
issues with alpha 1 that have been reported on the <A href=
"${link0}" target=_self  mailinglist.html??
 release="" opencms="">opencms-dev</A> mailing list. A couple of new
features have also been added to the 6.0 alpha 2 release.</p>
<p><strong>Who should use this 6.0 alpha&nbsp;2
version?</strong></p>
<p>This is an alpha version. Please don't expect it to be perfectly
stable. One of the most important Open Source philosophies is
"Release early, Release often", and this is what we intend to
do&nbsp;with this and subsequent 6.0 releases. If and how you
should use this version depends on what your goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are currently using any previous 6.0 
  development release (e.g. 6.0 alpha 1), you should upgrade to this new 
version.</li><li>If you are an IT&nbsp;professional or a company 
  working with OpenCms on a regular basis, you should&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;check 
  if and&nbsp;how your current websites, modules and functions can be ported to 
  the new release. Even though changes on the Java API level and changes on the 
  DB schema are to be expected until we reach the beta or even release candidate 
  state of the development, most of the big changes have already been made.</li><li>If you start a new project that is expected to go 
  live in about 3 months, you may use this version to build your project - but 
  be prepared for some extra work to update when new releases become available, 
  and also for some time figuring out the so far undocumented features if these 
  are required.</li><li>If you are working on a project with OpenCms 5.0.x 
  that has&nbsp;a delivery date soon, you should stick to the 5.0.x version 
  unless you absolutely require a feature of the 6.0 version.</li><li>If you are running a website based on OpenCms, and you plan to
implement some new features in the not so far future, you should
install this version on a test machine and check out the new
features.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When will the "final" release of OpenCms 6.0 be
available?</strong></p>
<p>This will greatly depend on the feedback for this release and
the following releases, especially regarding bugs. In case you find
any bug, please use the <a href="${link1}"
 target="_self">OpenCms bugzilla</a> to document it, or at least
post a note to the <A href=
"${link2}" target=_self  mailinglist.html??
 release="" opencms="">opencms-dev</A> mailing list. The more feedback and
code contributions are made, the faster we can fix the issues and
finish the development. Currently we expect the final release of
OpenCms 6.0 in Q4/2004 or Q1/2005.</p>
<p><strong>The most important new

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The most important new features in&nbsp;this release
compared to the 5.0.x version:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple websites can now be managed in one OpenCms 
  installation</li><li>The&nbsp;"Direct Edit" feature allows users to open 
  the editor directly from the websites front-end by pushing an "Edit" button 
  that appears on elements on the page (if the user has the permissions to edit 
  it)</li><li>Using the new resource type "XmlContent", buliding 
  structured content (e.g. news articles, product descriptions etc.) is really 
  easy and requires little or no programming</li><li>OpenCms now comes with a highly configurable template 
  with many advanced functions as additional default module</li><li>Multi-language versions of the same page and improved 
  support for managing multi language websites is integrated</li><li>Build-in support for full text search in HTML, PDF, 
  Word, Excel and Plaintext&nbsp;documents (based on Apache Lucene)</li><li>All contents in the VFS can now have a "publication 
  date" and an "expiration date" so they can&nbsp;appear / disappaer 
  automatically from a website</li><li>Resource permissions in the VFS are now managed in 
  ACLs instead of Unix - style</li><li>The OpenCms workplace has been rewritten in JSP, 
  adding new features and much improved usability&nbsp;(this task is not fully 
  finished)</li><li>Full support for multibyte languages (e.g. UTF-8)</li><li>Files in the VFS can now have multiple "siblings", 
  this is comparable to a "hard link" in a Unix file system and prevents broken 
  "VFS links" automatically</li><li>Properties on files can be "individual" or "shared" 
  among siblings</li><li>Implement "plugin" mechanism for editors and make 
  editors more configurable, so that other editor implementations (e.g. WYSIWYG 
  Java Applet) can be easily integrated in the workplace</li><li>Added optional WYSIWYG editor implementation of the 
  popular HtmlArea editor, this editor also works with Mozilla browsers</li><li>The setup wizard has been improved, also many "known 
  issues" (e.g. regarding encoding setting and Xerces version) have been fixed</li><li>The module API has been rewritten from the ground up, 
  now providing a clean interface to implement</li><li>Optimized the use of http headers, including use of 
  "304 - not modified" for resources that have not been modified</li><li>The resource type API has been enhanced, so that 
  resource types can be easily added without workarounds</li><li>The Workplace is now fully usable with Mozilla based 
  browsers (e.g. Firefox)</li><li>It's not longer required to "lock" a resource in the 
  Exlorer with the context menu manually, this is done automatically if the 
  "autolock" feature is enabled (this is also the default)</li><li>The static export has been fully rewritten,&nbsp;is 
  also features a new "on demand" mode for export of resources</li><li>Implement new,&nbsp;cleaned&nbsp;up&nbsp;XmlPage API 
  that&nbsp;replaces the&nbsp;old XmlTemplate for page data storage</li><li>The XmlPage structure is always validated by a W3C 
  XML Schema, to prevent creation form invalid content</li><li>The edited pages are now stored directly in the 
  location where they have been edited, the /system/bodies/ folder is not longer 
  required</li><li>The OpenCms VFS&nbsp;has been made much&nbsp;more 
  scalable, bottlenecks like the slow Exlorer tree have been removed</li><li>The OpenCms user management has been made independent 
  from the OpenCms VFS, so that other user directories can be "plugged" into the 
  system as a separate module</li><li>Publishing has been rewritten and is now much faster 
  especially with many resources</li><li>All resources in the OpenCms VFS now have a UUID</li><li>The database pooling has been replaced with DBCP from 
  Apache Jarkarta</li><li>All known issues with Oracle 9.x that where present 
  in 5.0.x have been solved</li><li>Logging now uses log4j from Apache Jarkarta</li><li>Heavily modified the database model and completely 
  rewrote the database access class layer</li><li>The configuration is now based on a new XML structure 
  that is read by Apache Digester (this task is not fully finished)</li><li>UTF-8 is now the default encoding</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TODO list to be finished before OpenCms 6.0 is
released:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenCms workplace is still not fully implemented 
  in JSP - all XmlTemplate using dialogs will be rewritten to JSP</li><li>We will write a "content relation 
  engine"&nbsp;(CRE)&nbsp;for resources in the VFS - this replaces the old 
  "channel" concept of the master module</li><li>More of the configuration will be transferred from 
  opencms.properties to the new Digester XML based configuration file, the 
  current opencms.properties will stay only for the database configuration - 
  this configuration will be moved to the XML in a relase after 6.0.</li><li>The most important management functions (e.g. cache 
  maintainance, system status) will be exposed to allow JMX containers to manage 
  OpenCms</li><li>Documentation need to be revised for old functions 
  and written for new functions</li><li>Testing and bug fixing - your feedback is required!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Regarding backward compatibility</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will be as backward compatible as possible with the
5.x releases. Existing content from 5.x will be easily importable,
automatically converted to the new format and require almost
no&nbsp;manual&nbsp;modification - at least if you
didn't&nbsp;somehow change the structure&nbsp;of the XML control
code of the 5.0.x&nbsp;page files.</p>
<p>For the sake of a clean and structured API, we have decided to
make improvements on the API level that will break existing
code.&nbsp;This means&nbsp;changes of Java code in templates or
custom classes&nbsp;will be necessary to upgrade from 5.x to 6.
Most obvious will be renaming the packages from com.opencms.* to
org.opencms.*. Making existing code work will hopefully be just a
matter of exchanging these import statements and some minor
adjustments.</p>
<p>We will try to provide a more detailed documentation for the
upgrade procedure from 5.0 to 6.0 as part of a later release. This
is on the TODO list.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding support for XmlTemplates and the "Master
Module"</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms 6 will have support for legacy XmlTemplates, but only
with an additional <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> that will not be
installed by default. All classes dealing with XmlTemplates will
stay in the com.opencms.* packages where they are now. We consider
XmlTemplate a "dead" technology and will not support it past the
6.0 release.</p>
<p>The "master module" technology of 5.0.x will be replaced by the
new XmlContent mechanism. Therefore all database tables that are
used for the master module and some others (like the "webusers"
table) have been moved to a separate module
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> that installs these
tables if required.</p>
<p>The current 6.0&nbsp;development release still requires XmlTemplates
because parts of the OpenCms Workplace are still not updated to
JSP. Therefore <em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> is currently installed
by default. This applies mostly to the "Administration" and the
"Workflow" views. As soon as these are rewritten to JSP the
<em>opencms-legacy.jar</em> will be moved to the optional
<em>org.opencms.legacy.compatibility</em> module. This is on the
TODO list.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding version numbers and CVS build
tags</strong></p>
<p>In case you want to check out OpenCms&nbsp;from the
CVS,&nbsp;please keep the following in mind: The CVS tag numbers
for all OpenCms 6 alpha releases&nbsp;are&nbsp;"build_5_5_x", e.g.
6.0 alpha 2 is "build_5_5_3". Until we finally publish OpenCms 6,
we will continue to use 5.x as internal CVS build tag numbers. 6
alpha will have CVS build tags 5.5.x, 6 beta will use 5.7.x,
and&nbsp;6 release candidates will use 5.9.x.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding compatibility&nbsp;with&nbsp;other JVMs /
Servlet containers / Databases</strong></p>
<p>OpenCms&nbsp;6.0&nbsp;alpha&nbsp;2&nbsp;requires Java 1.4.x. It won't
work with Java 1.3.x. It has not been tested on Java 1.5.x&nbsp;so
far, even though some variables called "enum" where renamed to
avoid conflicts with Java 1.5.x.&nbsp;<em>Users of the 6.0 alpha 1
release&nbsp;have reported that the current development version
does not run with Java 1.5.x - we currently have not investigated
if this is an issue in OpenCms or one of the many pre-build
external libaries we use</em> . We have tested only with SUNs
version of the JDK. However, we have removed the&nbsp;dependencies
from all sun.* packages that were present in OpenCms 5.0.x so it
should in theory run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release only on the Tomcat servlet engine.
OpenCms 6.0 alpha&nbsp;2 works "out of the box" with Tomcat 4.1.x
and Tomcat 5.0.x. No replacing of Xerces is required like in
OpenCms 5.0.x. Others have reported deploying pre 6.0 alpha version
successfully on other servlet containers like BEA Weblogic, SunONE
and JBoss.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL 4.0.x and Oracle
9.x. The MS SQL Server and the SAP DB port have not been updated to
OpenCms 6.0 so far, and we still need volunteers for this task. For
alpha 2, we also did some initial testing on MySQL 4.1.x and
apparently it works fine. Since MySQL 4.1 has a slightly different
syntax when creating tables with Unicode support, we have provided
a new database setup driver for MySQL 4.1.x.</p>
<p>In case you run OpenCms 6.0 on&nbsp;components different from or
default components (SUN JDK 1.4.x. / Tomcat 4.1.x or 5.0.x / MySQL
4.0.x / Oracle 9.x), please let us know by posting a message to the
OpenCms mailing list. We intend to collect a list of "supported
platforms". Also, if you had to patch some lines of code to make
OpenCms 6.0 run on your platforms, please contribute these so they
can be included in the official release.</p>
