        <h1>Installation of OpenCms 5.0</h1>
            
        This chapter provides information on how to install OpenCms using 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">Tomcat</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySql</a>. All installation 
        parts are described as single steps. After completing a step you 
        are strongly advised to verify the success.

        <h2>1 Install the Java JDK</h2>
        Install Java JDK 1.4 or later (from SUN <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/j2se/">http://java.sun.com/products/j2se/</a>).
        This version of OpenCms was tested with Java 1.4 only.
        Some features regarding file encoding where uses that are not available with 
        Java releases before 1.4.
        For details on how to install Java on your operating system,
        see the documentation that comes with it.

        <h2>2 Install Tomcat</h2>
        Note: OpenCms 5.0 requires a Servlet 2.3 / JSP 1.2 standards compliant container.
        Tomcat 4 is the reference implementation of this Standard.
        This release was tested with Tomcat 4.0.x and Tomcat 4.1.x.
        Older versions of Tomcat (3.x and earlier) do not support this standard and are thus not usable for OpenCms 5.0.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Install Tomcat from
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/index.html</a>
        into a folder of your choice. This is the CATALINA_HOME folder. Don't forget to set the environment
        variables CATALINA_HOME and JAVA_HOME.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Test the installation by running tomcat in standalone mode and check the examples. Note: Tomcat uses 
        port 8080 in standalone mode.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        If you wish you can combine the servlet-engine with a webserver like the Apache Web Server 
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/httpd.html">http://www.apache.org/httpd.html</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        To make sure Tomcat works with the correct charset to read and write files you should add the following
        parameter to the commandline that is used to start Tomcat:        
        <code>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code>        
        You can set the environment varibale <code>CATALINA_OPTS</code> to do so 
        (<code>CATALINA_OPTS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</code>).
        The default encoding of OpenCms since the 5.0 beta 2 release it <code>UTF-8</code>.
        <i>Note:</i> There are still some unsolved issues related to database connectivity
        with regards to the <code>UTF-8</code> encoding. The encoding might change again in a later release.

        <h2>3 Install MySQL</h2>
        Install MySQL from <a href="http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html">http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html</a>
        (see the MySQL documentation on <a href="http://www.mysql.com/documentation/index.html">http://www.mysql.com/documentation/index.html</a>). 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Note: On Windows-based systems MySQL has to be installed on the <code>C:\</code> drive
        and should be registered as service using <code>(your MySQL path)/mysql/bin/mysqld -install</code>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Start the MySQL server by running the service (WIN32) or executing 
        <code>(your MySQL path)/mysql/bin/mysqld</code> (UNIX).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Check that MySQL is running before you continue by starting the MySQL monitor 
        (command mysql in your MySQL bin folder).
        The database works correctly if a MySQL prompt appears after calling the monitor. 
        Quit the MySQL monitor by typing exit and go to the next step. 
        </p>

        <h2>4 Deploy the opencms.war file</h2>
        Copy the opencms.war file from the binary distribution ZIP file to <code>CATALINA_HOME/webapps/</code>. 
        Note: replace <code>CATALINA_HOME</code> with the real path to your Tomcat installation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Start (or restart) Tomcat. Tomcat will now deploy the web application OpenCms.
        <i>Note:</i> OpenCms can not be deployed as war only. 
        Make sure Tomcat does unpack the war file and creates the <code>CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opencms/</code> directory,
        placing the OpenCms files in this directory.        
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
        <h2>5 Install OpenCms using the Setup-Wizard</h2>
        Start the Setup-Wizard by pointing your webbrowser to 
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/opencms/ocsetup">http://localhost:8080/opencms/ocsetup</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        <i>Note:</i> Maybe you have to replace localhost with your servername. The port 8080 is only used if
        you start Tomcat in standalone mode.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Follow the instructions of the OpenCms Setup-Wizard. It will set up the opencms database and
        import all workplace ressources into the system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        For normal installations with MySql and Tomcat running on the same server all default settings
        will fit your needs.
        </p>

        <h2>6 Now your system is ready</h2>
        Now your system is ready to use. You can login with username: <code>Admin</code> and password: <code>admin</code>. 
        Please change the password as soon as possible. The login URL of OpenCms is:
        <a href="http://localhost:8080/opencms/opencms/system/login/">http://localhost:8080/opencms/opencms/system/login/</a>
        </p>
        
        <hr>

        <h2>7 Security issues</h2>
        
        <p>Finally after you have installed OpenCms you should have a look at the security.
        Change the Admin password of OpenCms by calling the user preferences 
        ("hammer" icon on the main screen of the workplace). 
        Then you can add a password to the MySQL database. Enter the following commands 
        at the MySQL command line.<br> 
        
        <p>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <pre>
use mysql;
insert into user values ('localhost', <i>'opencmsuser'</i>,
password('XXXXX'),'N','N','N','N','N','N','N','N','N',
'N','N','N','N','N'); 
insert into db values ('localhost', <i>'opencms'</i>, <i>'oopencmsuser'</i>,
'Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y'); 
flush privileges; 
        </pre>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
        
        <p>Make sure you replace <code>opencmsuser</code> and <code>opencms</code>
        with the name of your user and database in case you have changed them on the
        setup wizeard.
        
        <p>Don't forget to add the new user and password to all connect strings 
        of the database in your opencms.properties file. 
        Only the new user can now connect to the OpenCms tables. 
        For more information see the MySQL documentation.
